/**
 * @brief The ButtonField class
 *
 * A UI-type EffectField. This field is largely an EffectField wrapper around a QPushButton and provides no data that's
 * usable in the Effect. It's primarily useful for other UI functions (e.g. showing/hiding a dialog or other UI
 * elements). This field is not exposed to the external shader API as it requires raw C++ code to connect it to other
 * elements.
 *
 * As with all widgets created from EffectField::CreateWidget(), you should never interface with the resulting widget
 * directly (apart from adding it to a layout and deleting it when it's unnecessary). All signals/slots should pass
 * through ButtonField instead to keep consistency with every layer involved.
