/**
 * @brief The EffectRow class
 *
 * Primarily a way of grouping EffectField objects together. As UI objects, Effects are largely formatted as a table
 * and you can think of EffectRows as the rows of the table and EffectFields as the columns.
 *
 * Within Olive, keyframing is enabled on the EffectRow (rather than individual EffectFields) so all attached fields
 * will be keyframed together.
 *
 * Unlike EffectField, there's no reason to derive from EffectRow as it's simply a container of fields and a few
 * keyframe functions.
