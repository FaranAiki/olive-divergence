**Olive Divergence** is a divergent or a fork version of Olive Video 0.1.x
for personal use or for community use.

It contains many features and presumably bugs.

  1. Feature is better than debug.
  2. The code must be readable to infants.
  3. Fix the debug if you can.
  4. ....

**Use it at your own risks.**
*Tutorials are coming!*
