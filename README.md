# Olive Divergence

**Olive Divergence** is a divergent or a fork version of Olive Video 0.1.x
for personal use or for community use.

It contains many features and many presumably bugs.

This software's philosophies are:
  1. Feature is better than debug.
  2. The code must be readable to infants.
  3. Fix the debug if you can.
  4. ....
  
Dependencies:
  1. Cmake		-> Compile things
  2. Qt 5		-> Main window
  3. FFmpeg		-> Audio and video
  4. MuParser	-> Math library 
  5. ....

**Use it at your own risks.**
