      NOTE: While overriding changeEvent() is the official documented way of handling runtime language change events,
      I found it buggy to do it this way (some panels would change and others wouldn't, and the panels that did/didn't
      change would be different each time). The current workaround is calling Retranslate() on each panel manually
      from MainWindow::Retranslate which is triggered by its own changeEvent() that seems fairly reliable. Currently
      this function is mostly a no-op.
