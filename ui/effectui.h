/**
 * @brief The EffectUI class
 *
 * EffectUI is a complete QWidget-based representation of an Effect that can be added to any Qt layout. It overrides
 * CollapsibleWidget (meaning the Effect can be collapsed to just a titlebar to save space). The titlebar is
 * automatically set to the Effect's name and the contents are composed of a grid layout (QGridLayout) corresponding
 * to the Effect's EffectRow and EffectField children.
 *
 * Many EffectUIs can be created from a single Effect, and many Effects can be attached to a single EffectUI (provided
 * the Effects are all the same type). Neither gains ownership of each other and deleting an EffectUI without any other
 * work is perfectly safe (deleting an Effect with an open EffectUI however, is not).

   * @brief Check if a given Clip has an Effect referenced by this EffectUI
   *
   * Olive allows users to modify several effects (of the same type) with one UI representation. The behavior is if
   * multiple clips are selected that have effects of the same type, all those Effects can be modified by the same
   * EffectUI object. However this behavior is undesirable if a single Clip has more than one of the same type of Effect
   * (e.g. two or more blurs). In this scenario, the user will most likely expect two separate UI objects for each of
   * these effects individually, rather than consolidating them into one UI object.
   *
   * To address this, EffectControls will check this function to determine if this EffectUI already references
   * an Effect of this type from this Clip. If it does, it's assumed a new EffectUI should be made rather than
   * consolidating that Effect into the same EffectUI.
   *
   * @param c
   *
