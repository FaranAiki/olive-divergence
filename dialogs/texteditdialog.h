   * Set the editing mode of the editor. If TRUE, the dialog will interpret the string in `s` as rich text HTML and also
   * return rich text HTML through get_string(). It'll also show a toolbar with rich text options (i.e. font, italic,
   * underline, size, etc.) If FALSE, the dialog will run in plain text mode interpreting the string in `s` as plain
   * text and returning plain text through get_string(). It also will not show the rich text editing toolbar.
